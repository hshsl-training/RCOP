## Introduction

This week we're going to use RStudio in a way we haven't used before.
We will be using RStudio, to format and generate a slide show.

This lesson objectives are: 

1. Introduce participants to Quarto, its purpose, features and benefits.
2. Get participants acquainted to Quarto's document structure. 
3. Practice structuring documents using RMarkdown.

## What is Quarto?

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

* A publishing tool for creating interactive and dynamic documents. 

* With Quarto, you can create reproducible articles, presentation, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.  

* In the same RStudio Session, you can combine data analysis and data visualization, to support your article, presentation, website or other.

## Components of a .qmd file

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
The structure of a `.qmd` file is simple. 

Anything that goes inside of the hyphens is considered a YAML text. 
And anything that goes after the last trio of hyphens, can be a combination of R code chunks, Markdown and RMarkdown.

## What is YAML & RMarkdown?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**YAML** 

* YAML is a data serialization language for 
all programming languages. 

* Can be use to set up configurations in a file or website.

**RMarkdown** 

- RMarkdown is an extension of Markdown

- With this language you can format plain text with options such as:
  - headings
  - bold letters
  - italics
  - etc...
  - code chunks

## Exercise: Let's Practice!

:::{.r-fit-text}
**Scenario:**

Your supervisor is asking you to create a slide show about the the skills you have learn for the last few weeks. In this slide show, you need to answer the following questions:

1. What data do you chose to work with and why? (Markdown tip: use paragraph)
1. What questions did you had about the data that you wanted to answer in the R community of practice? (Markdown tip: use bulleted list)
1. What steps did you to take to process the data? (Markdown tip: use ordered list)
1. A graphical summary of what they found out? (Markdown tip: use code chunk with graph)

To accomplish this request, you will need to complete the following tasks:

 1. Create a .qmd file.
 2. Structure your presentation using RMarkdown
 3. Create the requested content
 4. Stylish your presentation using YAML
